This tone indicator is used to indicate that you're quoting {frontmatter.tag}. This tone indicator is similar to **/ref**, but used exclusively for {frontmatter.fullForm}.

<br />

## Why should I use this?

This tone indicator is useful when a statement may come off as concerning, rude, or confusing when not contextualized as a lyric. This is sometimes seen in chat application statuses where a user might post a concerning lyric when they're just a fan of the song being referenced.

## Examples within messages:

- It's a mess I don't make anymore, like a thousand times before {frontmatter.tag}
